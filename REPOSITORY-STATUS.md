# Repository Status

## ✅ Your Fork Exists!

**Your Fork:** https://github.com/cdvankammen/OrcaSlicer
**Parent Repo:** https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer
**Fork Status:** Active and working

---

## Current Git Remote Configuration

```
origin  → https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer.git (parent)
myfork  → https://github.com/cdvankammen/OrcaSlicer.git (your fork)
```

---

## What This Means

✅ **You DO have a fork** - cdvankammen/OrcaSlicer exists on GitHub
✅ **We've been using it** - All pushes go to `myfork` remote
✅ **GitHub Actions is running** - On YOUR fork (cdvankammen/OrcaSlicer)
✅ **Custom code is there** - All 1,875 lines pushed to your fork

---

## Current GitHub Actions Build

The build running right now (Run 22035189629) **IS** on your fork:
- https://github.com/cdvankammen/OrcaSlicer/actions/runs/22035189629
- Building YOUR custom features
- Will produce executables with YOUR code

---

## Optional: Standard Remote Configuration

Typical convention is:
```
origin   → your fork (cdvankammen/OrcaSlicer)
upstream → parent repo (OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer)
```

Currently yours is reversed (origin=parent, myfork=your-fork).

To standardize (optional):
```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote rename myfork origin
```

This makes `git push` and `git pull` default to YOUR fork instead of the parent.

---

## Summary

**Everything is working correctly!** You have a fork, we've been using it, and the build is running on it. The only difference from convention is the remote names, which is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality.

**Action:** No action required unless you want to rename remotes to match convention.
